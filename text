
Project Title:
Atomic brain app quiz Feature

introduction:
The importance of stem subjects to ensuring and promoting an IT driven Society cannot be overemphasized.

Statement of problem:
To design a quiz feature on an educational app for Teens to learn about any STEM subjects
in a fun way.

PROJECT GOALS:
>> Simple and clean design.
>> Easy navigation.
>> Fun Interaction.

About Atomic Brain:
Atomic brain is a secondary school chemistry quiz app that helps students to test their knowledge of 
the subject in a fun and Interactive way while also helping them build on their knowledge by giving
them answers to failed questions coupled with illustrative diagrams and charts.

Approach:
on working on this feature i opted for the lean approach which which basically emphasizes rapid sketching 
while putting consideration and practice the design thinking process.

Research:
Market Research;
 Adequate market research was carried out on competitor. This was not to engage in a parity 
war of features but to better understand the user pain areas and flaws in the implementation of features in the competitors 
apps.

User Research;
Due to time constrain and limited resources user interviews were not carried out and i used personas constantly
throughout the project to guide design decisions and prioritize implementation of features.

personas; My personas consisted of two different archetypes.

persona one;

Name: Micheal Emeka
Age: 15yrs
Gender: Male
Class: SS2
Location: Enugu
Student Type: Micheal is a smart student but he's not entirely confident about his knowledge of chemistry.
Tech Level: Micheal has a good knowledge about using a smart device.
Hobbies: 
>> Football
>> Gaming

Needs/Pain Points:
>> Micheal will be writing WAEC in fews months and he wants a platform that will help prepare him for that.
>> Micheal requires a way to boost he's confidence in chemistry.
>> He wants something Interactive and fun yet very educative to spend his spare time on.

persona Two;

Name: Bukola Adams
Age: 14yrs
Gender: Male
Class: SS1
Location: Lagos
Student Type: Bukola is an average student and just recent got into the senior school. she has a flair for 
science and would love to be a chemical Engineer. but she knows she has alot of work to do especially in chemistry.

Tech Level: Bukola just recently got a smart phone as a gift from her dad for her 14yr birthday. she's really not 
all that confident of her tech level.
Hobbies: 
>> Singing
>> playing the guitar

Needs/Pain Points:
>> Bukola desires to know more about chemistry.
>> She wants a platform she can use to test her knowledge constantly.
>> He wants something really simple to navigate since she's still new to using a smartPhone.
>> she desires something that will in some way encourage her to continue to learn.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
Based on personas needs and pain points, i came up with a number possible solutions; 
>> A simple and vibrant Inhterface.
>> Milestone Badges and stickers at every stage.
>> Simple graphical illustrations of every questions.
>> chemistry IQ Summary.
>> Team up with a friend feature
>> share milestone badges and sticker with friends.


IMPLEMENTED SOLUTIONS

Among the list of "possible solutions" some were implemented, were solutions that best focuses on our personas and
user demography.
>> A simple and vibrant Interface: a simple and yet vibrant Interface was implemented, this was done putting
into consideration that lots of the users are newbees to using smart phone and requires something is easy 
to navigate and yet very catchy.

>> Milestone Badges and stickers: after every hour 3 hours of quiz time or every 100 questions answered correctly, 
the user gets a milestone badge of commendation, this is to give a user a sense of encouragement and boost their confidence.

>> Share Milestone badge with friends: This was implemented to aid Interaction and a sense of healthy competition amongs pairs 
on the same platform.

>> Simple graphical illustrations for every question: Image tells a thousand stories, for every question theirs is simple illustrative diagram,
this is to help the user mine the thought pattern and narrow. this proves to aid quick reasoning.

>> Team up with a friend: this features is to aid interaction amongs pairs on the platform and also enhance progress level. with the feature a
 user can pair up with a friend on the same platform and tackle questions in real time.


 CONCLUSION

 Due to time  constrain final testing was not carried out but going by how the implemented features solved the various pain points of the
  different archetypes in our personas we can say that the Quiz feature was a huge success.
